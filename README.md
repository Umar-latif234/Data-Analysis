This Python-based data analysis project involves cleaning and visualizing a dataset to extract meaningful insights. The data cleaning process included handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting data types, and standardizing formats. Visualization was done using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations. The project concludes with a summary of key insights derived from the analysis, showcasing effective data preprocessing and visual storytelling for informed decision-making.
Text Sentiment Analysis(Task 2) analyzing textual data to determine sentiment polarity (positive or negative). It includes steps such as importing and exploring the dataset, cleaning and preprocessing the text using methods like tokenization and TF-IDF vectorization, and splitting the data for training and testing. The sentiment classification is carried out using machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naive Bayes. Model performance is assessed through accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports to determine the most effective model.
Fraud Detection System(Task 3) addresses the problem of detecting fraudulent transactions within a dataset. It begins with data loading and exploratory analysis, followed by preprocessing steps such as handling class imbalance and feature scaling. Various classification algorithms, including Decision Trees and Random Forests, are employed to identify potentially fraudulent cases. The model performance is evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices to ensure reliable detection, especially considering the rarity of fraud cases.
